## Description:
 The objective of this application is to build the back end for an e-commerce site. It utilizes a working Express.js API to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database.

The following acceptance criteria were kept in mind when developing this application:

```md
GIVEN a functional Express.js API
WHEN I add my database name, MySQL username, and MySQL password to an environment variable file
THEN I am able to connect to a database using Sequelize
WHEN I enter schema and seed commands
THEN a development database is created and is seeded with test data
WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application
THEN my server is started and the Sequelize models are synced to the MySQL database
WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia for categories, products, or tags
THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia
THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete data in my database
```

The following walk-through video demonstrates the functionality of the web application:

## Installation:
 The code can be downloaded via the E-Commerce folder on my Github page.

## Usage:
  This E-Commerce backend application is intended for easy navigation by using Insomnia to showcase the API routes.
  
  Alternatively, the user can download the files on the E-Commerce Github repository.
